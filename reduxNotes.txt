- Redux library is not built/designed for react specifically.
- redux Cycle: 
  Action Creator -> Action -> dispatch -> reducers -> state
  submit fomr -> the form -> form recv. -> depts. in Co -> dept data

always inside a reducer return new instance of whatever is getting updated.

Redux store is just a place to group a bunch of reducers and ActionCreators
